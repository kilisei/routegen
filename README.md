# A route generator

the files in ./assets where converted with ai generated code the remainng code i wrote myself

this works as of 10.12.25 but it may be not very configurable i want to add:
- mf only routes configuarble
  - a way to say that you want only jungle or goblin area
- route name prefix or template strings
- abillity to set max travel y and x,z between nodes
- coverter for snoopy skytils etc

- maybe make a gui? with visualization of the rount that would be fun i think
